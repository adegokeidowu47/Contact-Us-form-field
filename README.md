## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- I've learnt how to be more familiar with breaking point when designing a
responsive websites using @media query. e.g
```css
@media and screen(max-width: 550px) {
  /* ====== CSS codes ========= */
}
```

- Fast forward to JavaScript (Js):
  - Learnt how to write and make use of callback funtions.
  - Understanding deep knowledge about function definition e.g anonymous function, arrow function and so on.
  - Learnt about the Looping over nodes when select multiple DOM Object on the
  Website. e.g

  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i < radioLi.length; i++) {

      if (radioLi[i].checked) {
      //codes here
      break;
      }
    }
  ```

### Continued development

- Areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects, is writing AJAX codes for fetching the clients inputs from the form field and submit it to the server through JSON files format.

- Rewrite the form field code using reactjs and tailwind in the future.
